# PawFinder
PawFinder is a new way to find a dog to adopt or foster. It's a simple way to find dogs from local shelters and rescues that are looking for new homes. Create a profile and swipe to match with dogs from various rescues, and schedule an interview to meet the dog in person. Find your new furever friend today!

## About This Project
This project was originally meant to be created as a website using Bootstrap, but I wanted to challenge myself by creating a functional mobile app interface using Expo and React Native. Android users are able to scan the QR code and install the app to experience it themselves on their personal device. 

## User Journey
Stephanie is a young adult looking to contribute to society by fostering or adopting a dog. Browsing through the app store, Stephanie finds PawFinder, a mobile app for potential fosterers and adopters to connect with rescues and shelters that post profiles of dogs up for adoption. The user interface is simple and very familiar to her as a young adult who has previously used dating apps before. She is able to swipe through photos and profiles of cute dogs that she is interested in. She is able to adjust settings to search for a small, young, and black fur colored dog that is available for fostering or adopting nearby. If she matches with a dog (via mutual interest from the rescue that also swipes right on her profile), the two are connected, revealing a screen to start a chat, phone call, video call, or book an in-person appointment to meet together.
